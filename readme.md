# Snip - A Snip and Sketch alternative

Instead of copying screenshots directly to the clipboard this creates the file in the users `%TEMP%` and uses the path. And don't worry old screenshots are cleaned up on the next execution (but you should have `%TEMP%` on a RAM drive anyway)

Copying the path instead of the image data allows pasting the screenshot into file explorer.

## Usage

- Use [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) and rebind `win+shift+s`
- Above but with [AutoHotkey](https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey)

## Install

- Download the exe from the releases tab on the right
- Place the exe into your user folder `%USERPROFILE%`
